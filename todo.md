# todo

* google id tokens (just write tests now - need to write integration tests to check no save if submit the same user twice, and what happens if the token gets rejected -- need to also write some controller tests that have similar cases)
* google id tokens as an alternative to the bearer token -- need to check how that would be implmented in jwtrequestfilter to search for different header key and values (specifically related to google id tokens)
 
# longTermTodo
